## [1.18.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

#### Self-Improvement: SESSION-STATE, Daily Notes, VBR, Context Threshold

Four improvements to the proactive agent pattern in Domain 24:

- **SESSION-STATE.md** — always-on capture file (`memory/SESSION-STATE.md`) for corrections, preferences, decisions, and proper nouns. Written before responding when any of these occur (not only before destructive ops). Second read in compaction recovery after working-buffer.
- **Daily Notes** — rolling per-day log (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) of notable exchanges, discoveries, completed tasks, and errors. Survives compaction as a searchable history. Third read in compaction recovery.
- **Context threshold trigger** — working buffer is written proactively at ~60% context, not only at task boundaries. Prevents silent context loss mid-task.
- **Verify Before Reporting (VBR)** — explicit protocol: run the validation command and read the changed file before reporting done. Text change ≠ behavior change; test actual outcomes.
- Updated compaction recovery order in `commands/self-improve.md` `resume` mode: working-buffer → SESSION-STATE → daily notes → resource verification. "Never ask where were we?" rule added.
- New `state` mode in `commands/self-improve.md` — explicit slash command for capturing session state entries
- Example scaffold updated: `memory/SESSION-STATE.md` and `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` templates added to `examples/agent-self-improve/memory/`
- `.gitignore` recommendation updated: gitignore `memory/` entirely (daily notes grow fast)

## [1.17.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Closing `## Closing — Log learnings` section added to `commands/triage.md`, `commands/supply-chain.md`, and `commands/runtime-security.md` — each workflow now ends with an explicit step to log errors and learnings via `/platform-skills:self-improve log` immediately after completing work, preventing context loss across sessions
- PostToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json` (local, not committed) prompts incremental learning capture after every `git commit`

### Changed

- Promoted 10 learnings from v1.16.0 session to `CLAUDE.md` and reference guides (`references/supply-chain.md`, `references/runtime-security.md`, `references/kyverno.md`) as permanent agent rules

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — registration manifest explicitly declaring plugin name, version, author, skill (`SKILL.md`), and all 5 command paths so Claude Code uses consistent `/platform-skills:<name>` namespacing regardless of install directory name

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

#### Slash Commands

Five explicit slash commands added under `commands/` — invoked as `/platform-skills:<name>`:

- Linkerd routing rule added to SKILL.md tool classification
- `references/linkerd.md` added to `tests/validate-skill.sh` required references

### Changed
- CONTRIBUTING.md: fixed local install commands (`claude plugin install .` → `claude plugin marketplace add $(pwd)` + `claude plugin install platform-skills`); added upgrade flow; updated What We're Looking For to reflect current roadmap priorities

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

#### Reference Guides
- Added RBAC troubleshooting to `references/kubernetes.md`: 401 vs 403 diagnosis, `kubectl auth can-i` evidence collection, binding scope matrix (Role/ClusterRole × RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding), `ClusterRoleBinding` audit query

- Updated SKILL.md activation description and body framing for discoverability by any developer
- Fixed `assignees` format in `renovate.json` (removed `@` prefix)
- Fixed `kubeconform` flag in `validate.yml`: `-skip-kinds` → `-skip` (correct flag name for v0.6.4)
- Fixed `LICENSE` copyright placeholder `[yyyy] [name of copyright owner]` → `2026 Nitin Jain`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

#### Reference Guides
- Expanded AWS reference with tagging guidance: `default_tags` provider block, ASG `propagate_at_launch`, EBS/Lambda propagation gaps, AWS Config `required-tags` rule, cost allocation tag activation steps, org-level tag policy enforcement
- Expanded Azure reference with tagging guidance: `merge(local.common_tags, {...})` pattern, tag inheritance gap explanation, Azure Policy `deny`/`modify` enforcement, remediation task for existing resources, AKS managed resource group tagging
- Added tagging rule to SKILL.md: enforce a baseline via provider-level mechanisms; specific keys are an organizational decision

#### Example Assets
- Added real example assets for previously stub domains: `examples/kubernetes/*.yaml` (4 files), `examples/openshift/*.yaml` (2 files), `examples/aws/iam/*.json` (2 files), `examples/azure/workload-identity/` (`main.tf` + `serviceaccount.yaml`)

#### Testing
- Added `tests/validate-skill.sh` — checks SKILL.md frontmatter, all reference files exist, each example domain has at least one asset beyond README.md, SKILL.md references every reference file; wired into `validate.yml` as a blocking CI job

#### Developer Experience
- Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — GitHub Copilot automatically applies Platform Skills patterns (no Claude Code required)
- Added `VSCODE_INTEGRATION.md` — comprehensive guide for VSCode with Claude Code extension, GitHub Copilot split-screen, and browser workflows
- Added `QUICKSTART.md` — 5-minute install and first-use guide
- Added `INSTALLATION.md` — full installation methods, team setup, troubleshooting

#### Dependency Management
- Scoped Renovate automerge catch-all rule to explicit managers (terraform, helmv3, kubernetes, docker-compose) to prevent accidental automerge of GitHub Actions

### Fixed

#### CI/CD Workflows
- Fixed `validate.yml` and `release.yml` marketplace.json validation — field paths now match marketplace format (`plugins[0].version`, `plugins[0].description`, etc.)
- Replaced deprecated `actions/create-release` (archived action) with `gh release create` CLI in `release.yml`
- SHA-pinned `hashicorp/setup-terraform` in `validate.yml` — floating `@v4.0.0` tag was causing the workflow's own security check to fail
- Removed unused `actions/setup-node` step from publish-marketplace job

#### Documentation
- Fixed dead Discord `#` placeholder link in README — replaced with real URL
- Added `QUICKSTART.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, and `VSCODE_INTEGRATION.md` to README navigation and repository structure table
- Fixed hardcoded `v1.0.0` examples in CHANGELOG release checklist — replaced with `vX.Y.Z` placeholder
- Fixed Argo CD example Application `path:` fields — were pointing at Flux monorepo paths instead of Argo CD-appropriate paths
- Fixed Azure workload-identity `main.tf` — added `required_providers` block with minimum `azurerm >= 3.87.0`

### Changed

- README repositioned as handbook-first — skill layer described as optional, not the primary product
- Updated README repository structure tree to show real example files rather than `README.md`-only entries
- Trimmed VSCode install detail from README to a single pointer to VSCODE_INTEGRATION.md — install story now lives in one place
- Marketplace distribution: personal marketplace now named `platform-skills` (was `platform-skills-marketplace`)
- Owner contact updated to personal email
- All CLI command references updated: binary is `claude`, subcommand is `claude plugin` (not `claude-code skill`)
